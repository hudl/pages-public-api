If you need a server to do public-facing things for you, add your code here! This express server will do whatever you can't do purely in client-side Javascript (i.e. CORS resource proxy stuff).

### How to run
1. Make sure you have npm (node) installed
2. Clone repo
3. `cd` to cloned directory, `npm install` to get dependencies.
4. Finally, `npm start` to get it running.
